  <div class="post-content"><p>My name is Gina, and in June 2021 I decided it was time for a big change.</p>
<p>After a decade of creating and managing social-web-email content for education nonprofits, I needed something else. I felt stuck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought about a career shift well before the COVID-19 lock down of early 2020 but the pandemic, in many ways, fueled the desire for change even more‚Äîas I imagine it did for many people with the means to make those changes or were forced by circumstance.</p>
<p>I gave myself one year. By June 2022 I was to have a new job, with a signed offer letter. I accomplished the switch in six months.</p>
<p>This is how I broke down my approach üìÖ</p>
<ul>
<li>1-3 months of initial research into UX as a viable career option, including informational interviews</li>
<li>5-6 months of skill development and building my portfolio. This included bootcamps or other MOOCs and certification-style courses that were free or relatively cheap</li>
<li>4-6 months of actively looking for, interviewing, and ultimately securing an offer</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, that doesn‚Äôt neatly add up to 12 months but there‚Äôs some overlap in the plan.</p>
<h1 id="exploring-ux-as-a-career-">Exploring UX as a career üîç<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#exploring-ux-as-a-career-">#</a></h1>
<p>When I first looked at UX as a possible career path, I focused on product design because that&rsquo;s the information that was readily available. There wasn&rsquo;t a lot of information for new UXers on research and writing as a viable entry point into UX as an industry.</p>
<p>Naturally, this made me a bit anxious. I had some design experience‚Äîdeveloped out of a need in my unicorn role at nonprofits‚Äîbut nothing ‚Äúprofessional.‚Äù I was also a writer, so shifting my thinking from words to shapes was new and I had doubts. Behance and Dribbble were definitely not helping with the highly polished samples.</p>

<p>Alternative education routes were all the rage during the pandemic. It was like everyone and their aunt had a masterclass, coaching course, certification, and so on. I enrolled in a couple of online certification courses, which I‚Äôll only mention here but if folks are interested in reading more about what those were like, let me know and I&rsquo;ll write a separate piece on those.</p>
<p>Cost was a major factor in what I ultimately decided. And time. I was working a full-time job that paid an okay salary but wasn&rsquo;t enough to afford a multi-week, cohort-type program like General Assembly or Springboard. I also had enough debt on my plate that I didn&rsquo;t want to add to it if I didn&rsquo;t have to. Lots of decisions to be made.</p>

<em>(Udacity&rsquo;s &ldquo;Become a UX Designer&rdquo; nanodegree landing page)</em></p>
<p>I went with this because I did their Front-End nanodegree a year prior and was satisfied with that so I figured the experience would be similar. At the time I enrolled, they were running a multi-month deal.</p>

<p>I enrolled in this program a few months after the Udacity ND because the content was slightly different, and I got a half scholarship that made it affordable.</p>

<p>This one was probably the trickiest part of the career transition. How do you convince people you‚Äôre capable in the field you‚Äôre getting into with indirect experience?</p>
<p>This is where things also started to shift for me.</p>
<p>While I learned how to create design systems, wireframes, prototypes, surveys, and tests, I stumbled across UX writing. It was a rabbit hole I fell into and I know not how I got there. Needless to say, I was <em>very wired</em> upon discovering this as a viable UX discipline. Suddenly, the entry gate was wider.</p>
<p>As I continued to work through the certifications, I changed my tactic for the portfolio. Design was still important but because I didn‚Äôt have product design to showcase, I used what I had to highlight <em>my process in content design</em>. This included examples of web pages I helped lay out, information architecture and the site-map, and e-blasts I designed, along with content I wrote and why I made specific decisions. (I‚Äôll write more about specifics in another post. If you have specific questions about this, let me know.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-GsjHqFM/0/CdcHxTbzxVkcdLKHDNK32Kcc9bSbrJRBdpgb4677Z/O/i-GsjHqFM.jpg" alt="A snippet of my portfolio homepage, circa 2021"  />

<em>(A snippet of my portfolio homepage, circa 2021)</em></p>
<p>My portfolio was simple on purpose. I picked the top three projects I was really proud of that I thought showcased my ability to <em>think</em> design and execute strategically, while also thinking through language, voice, tone, and all the other wordy things that live in the content realm.</p>
<p>And it seemed to work.</p>
<h1 id="interviews">Interviews<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#interviews">#</a></h1>
<p>I applied to open roles early in my career switch process to learn about the hiring process and learn about what it‚Äôs like to be in UX generally. I also DM‚Äôd people on LinkedIn who posted about open roles to gauge whether my indirect skills would be worth considering.</p>
<p>This may be odd, but at this time‚Äîroughly four months into my plan‚Äîmy main objective wasn‚Äôt to land a job. It was to get information and learn how to fill the gaps I have to successfully land a job by my June 2022 deadline.</p>
<p>I landed a handful of interviews, some with notable companies like Mailchimp and Eventbrite.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs important to note that I didn‚Äôt go Wild West application spree. I was methodical about where I applied. Even though I wasn‚Äôt applying with the intent of landing a job (yet), I did apply as though I wanted the job at the companies I applied to. If I didn‚Äôt want to work at a specific place, I didn‚Äôt apply. All told, I applied to fewer than 20 open roles over the course of about 60 days‚Äîwhich might seem like a lot, but compared to the ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù approach I‚Äôve done in the past, where I‚Äôve applied to double, even triple that, 20 is very much on the low-end.</p>
<p>For most of the companies I applied, I received an initial interview. I moved to the second round to even fewer. Only one came back with an offer.</p>
<p>I accepted and started my new role in UX as a content designer in December 2021‚Äîsix months ahead of my own schedule.</p>
