[{"content":"There\u0026rsquo;s no right way to do it but maybe this will help.\nThe benefits of content and product design collaboration are no secret. Many words have been shared on Medium and Substack about why collaboration is important but few speak to the mechanics. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because there\u0026rsquo;s no right way to do it. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to talk about something without being prescriptive because people generally want to be told how to do something. Nevertheless, having examples of how to collaborate might help shed light on the ways content and product designers\u0026rsquo; roles overlap. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I collaborate with one of my product design colleagues, Sam (not her real name), with whom I have a very great relationship.\nAgain, there\u0026rsquo;s no right way to do this. There are factors at play that encourage collaborative flourishing or collaborative tolerance.\nWho am I? I\u0026rsquo;m a content designer at a company that provides SaaS in the events and hospitality industry. I\u0026rsquo;m embedded in a team of product designers and provide consulting to other UX teams that lack a designated content designer. As you can imagine, that\u0026rsquo;s a lot of personalities. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot of different team subcultures, different team practices, and so on.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t brute force great collaboration but you can encourage some contented form of it.\n(Photo by Amélie Mourichon on Unsplash)\nIs It Luck? Maybe. But personalities matter. A lot. It sounds too simple but really, you click or you clash. It\u0026rsquo;s a fact of work life (and elsewhere). Sam and I just so happen to click. Very well. So much so that we often joke about being separated at birth.\nEverything is easier when you gel with someone. Sam and I enjoy each other\u0026rsquo;s company despite living on opposite coasts as fully remote employees. We meet regularly for 1:1s and design sessions. Some are scheduled, others are ad-hoc. We confide in each other. We lean on each other as a resource. And it has served us both really, really well. I\u0026rsquo;ve been told our level of content-product collaboration is an outlier.\nOf course, it\u0026rsquo;s not just luck. You can\u0026rsquo;t will great collaboration into existence. It does take some effort and time to build that relationship, even if you\u0026rsquo;re like long-lost siblings.\nEstablish the Relationship This is obvious but people don\u0026rsquo;t want to talk about the effort needed to establish and maintain relationships. Especially work ones. If you get along well enough and the work gets done, well, that\u0026rsquo;s that. It\u0026rsquo;s also easy to not think about the effort when it works well because it just works. But the truth is that cultivating and maintaining really good collaborative relationships isn\u0026rsquo;t easy. And it takes effort. If we want to be fancy, we can call it The Art of Collaboration.\n\u0026ldquo;How to Work With Me\u0026rdquo; I have to credit Sam for how much she\u0026rsquo;s put in towards our friendship and collaboration. She makes it a point to get to know everyone she directly works with and I was no exception. Within weeks of joining Sam\u0026rsquo;s team, we had regular 1:1s. We covered the usual topics\u0026ndash;how we like to work, what was life before UX, how we best communicate, and so on. But these weren\u0026rsquo;t your standard \u0026ldquo;get to know you\u0026rdquo; chats. Sam and I were doing a conversational version of the How to Work With Me document. 1 2 3\nWe talked about:\nHow we worked: Did we prefer utter solitude and asynchronous time? Did we crave total collaboration and always synchronous? Or did we like a balance? When we got into \u0026ldquo;the zone\u0026rdquo;: Did it happen morning, midday, afternoon, or never? Where did we like to work: Directly in the Figma files? Static documents? A combination? What knowledge and experience do we have: What did we both share, and what could we teach each other? And this isn\u0026rsquo;t a one-time topic either. We regularly come back to these questions because people are dynamic. Priorities and projects change. Through constant reassessment of our partnership, we can continue to reach out to each other during scheduled meetings and ad-hoc design jams. We might not work directly on the same projects as before, but this open communication allows us to continue being the dynamic collaboration duo that we are.\nComplement Each Other Sam and I don\u0026rsquo;t emphasize our roles as product and content designers. We are UX designers with shared and specialized skills. We are solving the same design problem. A lot of our technical skills overlap, which makes working in Figma easier, but the exciting part of our collaboration happens in our discussions while we design. It\u0026rsquo;s where our strengths play into each other and we learn from each other. I bring journalism/socio-psychology/marketing to the mix, and Sam comes with business acumen and real-world hospitality experience.\nI observe product designers go straight for the jugular of solving the problem. To balance out the sprint to designing, I slow things down a little. I get us thinking about the information we\u0026rsquo;re piecing together. I can see what we\u0026rsquo;re attempting to solve but what is the actual objective with the thing we\u0026rsquo;re creating?\nTapping into OOUX, we do quick and dirty outlines of our primary objects, user roles, and actions. We then talk about the relationships between everything, sometimes mapping it out with arrows on more complex workflows. This helps us have a clearer picture of what the things are, and how a user interacts with that thing.\nWe also prioritize information and identify what\u0026rsquo;s absolutely necessary and what\u0026rsquo;s auxiliary. We talk about why a label works or doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. We discuss the implications of specific terminology and check for audience fit. We borderline get philosophical. We have disagreements and argue with each other about design decisions\u0026ndash;visual and content. It all leads to a near-harmonious working relationship that\u0026rsquo;s resulted in many great designs.\n(Photo by Hugo Rocha on Unsplash)\nTrust Design is a vocation of the personally fraught alongside shared reward. We get to work independently with minimal guidance or work in a creative fishbowl. We are precious about our work, both design and writing. When this territoriality is left unchecked, we can fall into animosity and distrust. This makes working with others awkward, uncomfortable, and precarious.\nOf course, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be like this\u0026ndash;even with peers you don\u0026rsquo;t quite get on with. Once you break free from the limits of taking critique too personally, you can easily move into building trust. Critique, when done correctly, is an ego boost but also shows the skills and knowledge you have to your peers.\nWorking with Sam is a continuous cycle of trust and open communication. When we have reservations or doubts about something we bring it up. We talk through critique while encouraging each other\u0026rsquo;s efforts. Sam writes the first draft of nearly everything she designs, and I walk her through why things work as they are and how they can be improved. I teach her how to think about the words, language, and information in a way that can be scaled to all of the designs she works on. Sam reciprocates by teaching me how to use Figma to design elements for a larger product. By teaching me how to use Figma, Sam is comfortable with me editing in her files. By teaching her basics of writing, I trust her to do a great first draft.\nThis is our design session. This is how we collaborate.\n-30-\nMaymin, S. (2020, July 21).

The changes from working in marketing/communications in the nonprofit education sector have been huge. Here are some quick things I learned about searching for a new role, what content design entails, and more.\nFAANGs set the narrative, but they can be misleading When you have really big tech companies like the FAANGs (Meta [fka Facebook], Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google), it seems inevitable that they’ll dominate the narrative about what it means to work in tech.\nWhen I first toyed with the idea of changing careers I was skeptical about corporate work in general and tech specifically. From the cultish culture to the high-speed, low-drag work style, I thought for sure I’d drown. I mean, working in nonprofits was no walk in the park but you read stories by tech folks and it all just sounds abysmal. There was also the question of whether I was willing to put a lot of energy into fighting my way through a male-dominated sector.\nAfter a handful of interviews and landing my current role, however, I realized this wasn’t true. Maybe it’s UX, maybe it’s my employer, or maybe tech is getting better. I’m not entirely sure. What I do know is that I work with a beauteous mix of people from around the world, and I’ve enjoyed my time with them thus far. I haven’t fought “that fight.”\nAnd what about that high-speed, low-drag work style?\nDespite being within the tech stack, I haven\u0026rsquo;t felt the insanity I\u0026rsquo;ve often read about. But I\u0026rsquo;m in UX, so it might be different for engineers.\nI’m not going to lie though. There are days where a project needs to be turned around rather quickly. There are kerfuffles here and there. But for the most part, this new role has been very balanced.\nDisappearing into the zone I\u0026rsquo;ve always considered myself a very quick and efficient worker. But a year as a UX content designer made me understand and even appreciate why I got to be so quick.\nWorking for nonprofits in the past necessitated being very fast amid a caravan of distractions throughout the day and constantly pivoting. Out of this state of affairs was borne the need to be very, very fast. And efficient. It was a certain kind of hell. There was a lot of talk about “protecting your time” and finding a balance for focus time and meetings but that seemed to be an option available only to a certain few. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get into the zone.\nI brought this hyper convoluted and anxious need to be fast with me into my current role as a content designer. Snap snap snap. Churn out the work and keep moving. It took me about four months to realize I actually didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be this way. And what a relief this was.\nWhile I retained a healthy element of my quick-paced efficiency, I looked even more closely at guarding my time. First I tried blocking chunks of time between meetings to avoid the dreaded back-to-backs. It kind of worked… for a time. These chunks ranged between 30 minutes to an hour so it wasn’t as conducive for meaningful uninterrupted time to really get into the zone. The context-switching between meetings and tasks was more exhausting than just having a succession of meetings.\nNext I blocked off whole mornings or afternoons, which seemed to work with different time zones. Since half of my immediate team is based out of the West Coast, getting 2-3 hours in the morning was doable. Again. This sort of worked. The string of meetings every day that crept onto my calendar and kept that “zone” elusive.\nI was left with at least one last option: block an entire day as a “no meeting” day. But I couldn\u0026rsquo;t really do this could I? It seemed uncouth. Would I come across as inaccessible? Uncollaborative? I kept going back and forth on this until I learned that whole teams were doing this as a general practice.\nI spoke to my team about it. Everyone was onboard! Actual practice varies but my “no meeting day” has been respectfully observed, and I guard it like a dog and its bone. This isn’t to say I\u0026rsquo;m completely inflexible. I do make allowances when no other dates or times can be found but this has been extremely rare.\nNow I get at least a full day of uninterrupted time to really, deeply focus on my work. We still do asynchronous communication but no one’s obligated to respond right away. In summary, this set-up has been working really well.\nContent design is UX design When I first started this new role, the name “content designer” was a recent change from “UX writer,” which was previously “technical writer.”\nIn a lot of ways, “content designer” more accurately reflects the work we\u0026rsquo;re doing alongside product designers. And this may be why the department opted to change it. Unsurprisingly, the title can be confusing to most at first. After all, thinking about content as design the same way visual graphics is design is a relatively new phenomenon. It’s not just about words. It’s not just about writing.\nIn a way that wasn’t possible in my past roles, I fell into a comfortable position of evangelizing what content designers do and how we collaborate with product designers. I felt very at home in Figma and working alongside product designers building, iterating, and analyzing design explorations. My constant appearance has paid huge dividends for content as well as localization and accessibility. I even started incorporating OOUX principles into my work which has been really helpful for tackling complex design challenges.\nLearning, sharing, leading Professional development was something I jumped on really early. I love learning, and one thing I’ve come to enjoy is teaching others what I’ve learned, and sharing learning opportunities to others.\nSince starting, I’ve attended a few conferences and webinars, and amassed a healthy list of events to share with my UX colleagues. And these aren\u0026rsquo;t limited to content design and UX writing either. I collect a wide range of topics that may be of interest and relevance to my teammates, from ecosystem mapping and UX research to accessibility and information architecture.\nThis sharing has resulted in multiple initiatives, including a yet-to-be launched weekly digest that better aggregates and consolidates this information. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to be part of this resource and can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see how it grows in the coming year.\nI’m also putting together a training and development program for my content colleagues that will be expanded to include product designers. It\u0026rsquo;s still in the early stages but initial conversations with my content design manager are promising.\nI’m also on a few other committees focused on team building, skill building, style guide work, and more. Dream big. Find those who\u0026rsquo;ll support your ideas and push back when it seems too fantastical. I’ve definitely grown a lot more in the my first 12 months as a content designer than any other place.\nImproving where improvements can be made I\u0026rsquo;ll end with this one: I weirdly enjoy systems and processes, and organizing them in an efficient way that benefits my colleagues. This includes the utter tedium of documentation.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to work in a design and iterate and iterate without pausing to document those iterations and making note of why they work or not, or the questions that were raised and their answers. But continuing down this path could lead to problems later on when redesigns happen, or a project is revisited after being shelved for a time.\nThe upfront effort is no small feat but it makes what comes later easier. That\u0026rsquo;s the idea, anyway.\nMy output from this includes modifying and experimenting how we create content design briefs, how to document my achievements throughout the year, making a push to use Jira as a centralized way to track our tasks and work seamlessly with product managers and developers.\nIt’s all still a work in progress but the changes that we’ve made in my first year have been tremendous. I’m excited to see what Year 2 brings.\n-30-\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/learnings-year-one-content-design/","summary":"It’s been one year since I started my role as a UX content designer.

I felt stuck.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve thought about a career shift well before the COVID-19 lock down of early 2020 but the pandemic, in many ways, fueled the desire for change even more—as I imagine it did for many people with the means to make those changes or were forced by circumstance.\nI gave myself one year. By June 2022 I was to have a new job, with a signed offer letter. I accomplished the switch in six months.\nThis is how I broke down my approach 📅\n1-3 months of initial research into UX as a viable career option, including informational interviews 5-6 months of skill development and building my portfolio. This included bootcamps or other MOOCs and certification-style courses that were free or relatively cheap 4-6 months of actively looking for, interviewing, and ultimately securing an offer Okay, that doesn’t neatly add up to 12 months but there’s some overlap in the plan.\nExploring UX as a career 🔍 When I first looked at UX as a possible career path, I focused on product design because that\u0026rsquo;s the information that was readily available. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of information for new UXers on research and writing as a viable entry point into UX as an industry.\nNaturally, this made me a bit anxious. I had some design experience—developed out of a need in my unicorn role at nonprofits—but nothing “professional.” I was also a writer, so shifting my thinking from words to shapes was new and I had doubts. Behance and Dribbble were definitely not helping with the highly polished samples.\nBootcamps, academies, MOOCs, oh my 💻 Alternative education routes were all the rage during the pandemic. It was like everyone and their aunt had a masterclass, coaching course, certification, and so on. I enrolled in a couple of online certification courses, which I’ll only mention here but if folks are interested in reading more about what those were like, let me know and I\u0026rsquo;ll write a separate piece on those.\nCost was a major factor in what I ultimately decided. And time. I was working a full-time job that paid an okay salary but wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough to afford a multi-week, cohort-type program like General Assembly or Springboard. I also had enough debt on my plate that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to add to it if I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to. Lots of decisions to be made.\n(Udacity\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Become a UX Designer\u0026rdquo; nanodegree landing page)\nI went with this because I did their Front-End nanodegree a year prior and was satisfied with that so I figured the experience would be similar. At the time I enrolled, they were running a multi-month deal.\n(Parsons x Yellowbrick’s UX Design Foundations landing page)\nI enrolled in this program a few months after the Udacity ND because the content was slightly different, and I got a half scholarship that made it affordable.\nBuilding the portfolio 🚧 This one was probably the trickiest part of the career transition. How do you convince people you’re capable in the field you’re getting into with indirect experience?\nThis is where things also started to shift for me.\nWhile I learned how to create design systems, wireframes, prototypes, surveys, and tests, I stumbled across UX writing. It was a rabbit hole I fell into and I know not how I got there. Needless to say, I was very wired upon discovering this as a viable UX discipline. Suddenly, the entry gate was wider.\nAs I continued to work through the certifications, I changed my tactic for the portfolio. Design was still important but because I didn’t have product design to showcase, I used what I had to highlight my process in content design. This included examples of web pages I helped lay out, information architecture and the site-map, and e-blasts I designed, along with content I wrote and why I made specific decisions. (I’ll write more about specifics in another post. If you have specific questions about this, let me know.)\n(A snippet of my portfolio homepage, circa 2021)\nMy portfolio was simple on purpose. I picked the top three projects I was really proud of that I thought showcased my ability to think design and execute strategically, while also thinking through language, voice, tone, and all the other wordy things that live in the content realm.\nAnd it seemed to work.\nInterviews I applied to open roles early in my career switch process to learn about the hiring process and learn about what it’s like to be in UX generally. I also DM’d people on LinkedIn who posted about open roles to gauge whether my indirect skills would be worth considering.\nThis may be odd, but at this time—roughly four months into my plan—my main objective wasn’t to land a job. It was to get information and learn how to fill the gaps I have to successfully land a job by my June 2022 deadline.\nI landed a handful of interviews, some with notable companies like Mailchimp and Eventbrite.\nIt’s important to note that I didn’t go Wild West application spree. I was methodical about where I applied. Even though I wasn’t applying with the intent of landing a job (yet), I did apply as though I wanted the job at the companies I applied to. If I didn’t want to work at a specific place, I didn’t apply. All told, I applied to fewer than 20 open roles over the course of about 60 days—which might seem like a lot, but compared to the “all or nothing” approach I’ve done in the past, where I’ve applied to double, even triple that, 20 is very much on the low-end.\nFor most of the companies I applied, I received an initial interview. I moved to the second round to even fewer. Only one came back with an offer.\nI accepted and started my new role in UX as a content designer in December 2021—six months ahead of my own schedule.\n-30-\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/hello-world/","summary":"A quick introduction of yours truly.","title":"Hello, World"}]
